## Part 2 – Reflection
  I learned how to use remote servers and ssh while also learning how to use git along with it. Being able to use unix based systems \
  and ssh into remote servers and edit files with vim are very useful skills. This quarter taught me a lot about useful skils and learning \
  how to handle various systems that will be useful at a job.
